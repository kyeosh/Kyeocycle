The detectall.py  code is meant to to be installed on a Raspberry Pi to accutate relays when a Bluetooth (BLE) beacon is detected.

The detectallkey.py code does the same thing but waits for an input on GPIO 38 . If an input is detected, the program activates the relays if not the program waits for the bluetooth beacon.
